# Checkout Session Fulfillment — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-06-25  
**Status:** Approved  

---

## Overview

When a checkout session is created, it should synchronously fulfill the action encoded in its configuration. For the `create_subscription` action this means: creating a draft subscription, creating a draft invoice against it, and creating an initiated payment record against that invoice — then storing all resulting IDs on the checkout session record.

No gateway calls, no webhooks, no finalization occur during this flow. Everything stays in draft/initiated state until the checkout is completed externally (e.g. Stripe redirects back).

---

## Section 1: Draft Subscription via Existing DTO Field

**No new flag is added.** `dto.CreateSubscriptionRequest` already has `SubscriptionStatus types.SubscriptionStatus`. The checkout service always passes `SubscriptionStatus: types.SubscriptionStatusDraft`.

**Current `CreateSubscription` behavior when `status = draft`:**
- Subscription is created in `draft` status
- Invoice creation is **skipped** (lines 421-422 in subscription service)
- `PaymentBehavior` and `CollectionMethod` are left as-is (plan/system defaults)

**Invoice creation (checkout service responsibility):**  
After getting the subscription back, the checkout helper calls `invoiceService.CreateSubscriptionInvoice(ctx, req, params, flow, isDraftSubscription=true)` to create a draft invoice. The `isDraftSubscription=true` flag prevents finalization, gateway calls, and webhooks — the invoice stays in `DRAFT` status with no invoice number.

**What stays unchanged:** All existing callers that create draft subscriptions without wanting an invoice are unaffected.

## Section 2: `CreatePaymentForCheckout` on PaymentService

**New method** added to `PaymentService` interface:

```go
// CreatePaymentForCheckout creates a minimal payment record in INITIATED status
// for a checkout session without triggering payment lifecycle processing.
// TODO: migrate to full payment lifecycle method when payment lifecycle service is released
CreatePaymentForCheckout(ctx context.Context, invoice *invoice.Invoice, gateway types.PaymentGateway) (*dto.PaymentResponse, error)
```

**Behavior:**
- Reads `Amount`, `Currency` directly off the passed `*invoice.Invoice` — no DB lookup
- Builds a `payment.Payment` domain object:
  - `DestinationType = INVOICE`, `DestinationID = invoice.ID`
  - `PaymentMethodType = PAYMENT_LINK`
  - `PaymentStatus = INITIATED`
  - `PaymentGateway = gateway`
  - `TrackAttempts = false`
- Calls `paymentRepo.Create(ctx, payment)` directly — no gateway, no processor, no webhooks
- Returns `*dto.PaymentResponse`

## Section 3: Checkout Service Refactor

### `Create` flow (revised)

```
Create(ctx, req)
  │
  ├─ validate request
  ├─ build CheckoutSession domain object
  ├─ repo.Create(ctx, session)            ← session persisted first
  │
  └─ fulfillCheckoutAction(ctx, session)  ← new private method
```

If `fulfillCheckoutAction` fails at any point:
1. Set `session.CheckoutStatus = failed` and `session.FailureReason = err.Error()`
2. Call `repo.Update(ctx, session)` to persist the failure
3. Return the original error to the caller

The session record is always updated to reflect the terminal failure state so callers and operators can observe what went wrong.

### `fulfillCheckoutAction` dispatcher

```
fulfillCheckoutAction(ctx, session)
  │
  ├─ switch session.Action:
  │    case create_subscription:
  │      sub, invoice  ← createDraftSubscriptionWithInvoice(ctx, session)
  │      payment       ← createCheckoutPayment(ctx, invoice, session.PaymentProvider)
  │      session.CheckoutInvoiceID = &invoice.ID
  │      session.CheckoutPaymentID = &payment.ID
  │      session.Result = &CheckoutResult{
  │          CreateSubscriptionResult: {
  │              SubscriptionID: sub.ID,
  │              InvoiceID:      invoice.ID,
  │              PaymentID:      payment.ID,
  │          }
  │      }
  │
  └─ repo.Update(ctx, session)    ← shared step, always runs after switch
```

The `repo.Update` lives outside the switch so all future action types follow the same pattern — they only differ in how they populate the IDs and result.

### `createDraftSubscriptionWithInvoice` (private helper)

1. Build `dto.CreateSubscriptionRequest` from `session.Configuration.CreateSubscriptionParams`:
   - `CustomerID` from session
   - `PlanID`, `Currency`, `BillingPeriod`, `StartDate`, `EndDate`, `LookupKey`, `Metadata` from config
   - `SubscriptionStatus = types.SubscriptionStatusDraft`
2. Call `subscriptionService.CreateSubscription(ctx, req)` → `*dto.SubscriptionResponse`
3. Build `dto.CreateSubscriptionInvoiceRequest` from the subscription
4. Call `invoiceService.CreateSubscriptionInvoice(ctx, invoiceReq, paymentParams, InvoiceFlowSubscriptionCreation, isDraftSubscription=true)` → `(*dto.InvoiceResponse, *subscription.Subscription, error)`
5. Return `(subResp, invoiceDomain)`

### `createCheckoutPayment` (private helper)

1. Map `session.PaymentProvider` → `types.PaymentGateway`
2. Call `paymentService.CreatePaymentForCheckout(ctx, invoiceDomain, gateway)`
3. Return `*dto.PaymentResponse`

## Files Touched

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `internal/ee/service/checkout_session.go` | Add `fulfillCheckoutAction`, `createDraftSubscriptionWithInvoice`, `createCheckoutPayment`; update `Create` to call fulfillment |
| `internal/ee/service/payment.go` | Add `CreatePaymentForCheckout` with TODO comment |
| `internal/domain/payment/service.go` (interface) | Add `CreatePaymentForCheckout` to `PaymentService` interface |

No changes to subscription service, invoice service, or any DTO outside the payment service.

## What Is NOT in Scope

- Checkout session activation / apply step (converting draft → active after Stripe callback)
- Gateway redirect URL generation
- Webhook events on draft creation
- Subscription phase support in the checkout config (phases are rejected for draft subs)
